# eventBook

eventBook is an iOS application that utilizes Firebase to allow for a simple event creation and RSVP service. Users of the app can create accounts, RSVP to events, and create events of their own. This app makes use of the Model-View-Controller concept, where data retrieved from the API is stored in a User/Post model locally, and then manipulated as User and Post objects by the controller. The view is updated by the controller using data from the model.
